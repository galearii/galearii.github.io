I came across an interesting tweet in response to the recent Chinese government [suspending individual tourist permits to Taiwan](https://www.ft.com/content/6ba14934-b35e-11e9-8cb2-799a3a8cf37b).

Basically, the person is saying that, as long as a Chinese citizen has a valid visa from a country other than Taiwan and China, s/he may apply to enter Taiwan from the local Taipei representative office without being restricted by the current suspension of individual tourist permits.

I looked on the website of Taiwan's immigration agency and found that it is indeed possible for [a Chinese citizen residing outside of China to apply to enter Taiwan](https://www.immigration.gov.tw/5385/7244/7250/7257/7266/36084/). It also looks like the procedure is pretty easy and involves only the applicant.

This can be useful for future conferences that Taipei Tech English hosts.
