I have recently had two very embarrassing incidents of messing up the cover of a book design. This post serves as a reminder to myself that I shouldn't allow this to happen again. Three doesn't make a charm in this case.

The first incident is the "z" that goes after Taipei Tech on the handbook cover of the Literary Fantasy and Its Discontent (2018) conference hosted by Taipei Tech Department of English (screenshot below). This happened in November 2018.

The second incident is the missing "y" in the Taipei Tech logo on the cover of the school's 2019 English brochure (photo below). This happened in June 2019.

In both cases, I think the main reason why the mistake was not picked out before the book went to press is that the cover always needs extra processing, and by the time the design was approved for printing, I had been revising for too many long that I was just too tired out. Of course, I know this doesn't justify the fact that I made a mistake.
